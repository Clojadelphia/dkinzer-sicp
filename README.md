[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dkinzer/sicp.philly.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dkinzer/sicp)

This is a working repository to keep my solutions to SICP problem sets
as part of my participation in the SICP.philly study group.
It's set up to run the problems as assertions (I like that style of thinking).

##Requirements
* MIT-Scheme
  - On MacOSX `brew install mit-scheme` should do the trick.
  - Or try `make compile-scheme`
  - Otherwise see http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme

##Use
`make`
