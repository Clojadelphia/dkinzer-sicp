[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dkinzer/sicp.philly.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dkinzer/sicp.philly)

This is a repository of my solutions to the [SICP][1] exercises as part of my
participation in the [SICP.philly][2] study group.  It runs the problems as
assertions.

##Requirements

* MIT-Scheme
  - On MacOSX `brew install mit-scheme` should do the trick.
  - Or try `make compile-scheme`
  - Otherwise see http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme

##Use
- `make`     to run assertions for all the sections.
- `make #.#` to run assertions for a single section.
